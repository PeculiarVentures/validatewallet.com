            <h3>WalidateWallet Privacy Policy</h3>
        </div>

        <p>
            We respect your right to privacy. This privacy policy has been
            developed to inform you about the
            privacy practices used by ValidateWallet in connection with its websites, products and services.
         </p>
        <p>
        The privacy policy will inform you about what data is collected, how we use such data,
            if data is stored, how you opt out of your data being used, and the security provisions
            around storing your data and how to correct or update your data.
        </p>

        <h5>What information do we collect?</h5>

        <p>We collect as little information about you and your interactions with our service
            as we can and still provide the services you come to us for.
        </p>

        <p>
        We do keep web server logs so we can diagnose problems should they occur.
        </p>

        <p>
        We also use Google Analytics so that we may have an idea of how much our services are used.
        </p>

        <h5>What do we use your information for?</h5>
        <p>
        The information we collect is used to provide or improve the services you come to us for.
        </p>

        <p>
        This may include helping you validate wallet addresses, improving
            customer service or the performance of the site.
        </p>


        <h5>Data retention</h5>
        <p>
        We do not keep any data you send to us, including server logs for longer than 30 days.
        </p>

        <h5>How do we protect your information?</h5>
        <p>
        We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your
            personal information when you perform a transaction with us. First and
            foremost we limit what information is sent from your browser to our
            service to the minimal set necessary.
        </p>

        <p>
        When information must be sent to our servers it is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL),
            sensitive information is then encrypted in our databases.
        We have limited the people who can access the systems and databases that contain
            customer information above and beyond the basic systems that operate our service.
        </p>

        <h5>What happens to personal information if an account is terminated?</h5>
        <p>
        If your account is terminated (either voluntarily or involuntarily) all of your
            personally identifiable information is removed unless there are legal obligations
            to retain the information longer in such cases the information is placed in
            &ldquo;deactivated&rdquo; status and they are removed as soon those legal obligations are resolved.
        </p>

        <h5>Use of cookies and beacons to fulfill services</h5>
        <p>Like most online businesses we use cookies and web beacons on
            our websites and to gather and analyze non-personal information such as the
            visitorâ€™s IP address, browser type, ISP, referring page, operating system,
            date/time and basic geographical information.
            </p>
        <p>
        We also use cookies to provide session management as a means to improve
            your user experience with our services.
        </p>

        <h5>Use of server logs for diagnostics or to gather statistical information</h5>
        <p>
        Our servers automatically record information (&ldquo;Log Data&rdquo;) created by your use of our services.
        </p>

        <p>Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system,
            the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device and application
            IDs, search terms, and cookie information. We use this information to diagnose and improve
            our services. We will either delete the Log Data or remove any account identifiers, such
            as your username, full IP address, or email address, after 30 days
            </p>

        <h5>Do we disclose any information to outside parties?</h5>
        <p>
        We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information.
        </p>
        <p>
        We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply
            with the law or protect our rights, property, or safety.
        </p>

        <p>
        It is our policy to notify customers of requests for their data from law
            enforcement unless prohibited from doing so by statute or court order.
            Law enforcement officials who believe that notification would jeopardize an
            investigation should obtain an appropriate court order or other process
            that specifically precludes member notification, such as an
            order issued pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &sect;2705(b).
        </p>
